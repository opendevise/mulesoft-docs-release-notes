== Migration Guide

For first time installment, please refer to xref:studio/anypoint-studio-6.1-with-3.8.1-runtime-release-notes.adoc#hardware-requirements[Studio 6.1 release notes] for hardware requirements and known issues.

Users running Studio 6.0 can update to this new version directly from the Studio xref:6@studio::studio-update-sites.adoc[Update Site]. +
From the previous versions of Studio 6.0.0, 6.0.1 and 6.1.0, there is no special migration needed. If you want to migrate from Studio 5.4.3 or older to 6.1.1, you must download the latest version from Anypoint Studio download site https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[here].

When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.


[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.

== Eclipse Plugin

If you are using Studio as an Eclipse plugin, you can get this version of Studio using the Eclipse update site `+http://studio.mulesoft.org/r5/plugin+`.

This allows you to download Anypoint Studio core and third-party components version 6.x.x and with an embedded version of Mule Runtime v3.8.x along with other optional components. +
