== Migration Guide

For first time installment, refer to xref:studio/anypoint-studio-7.1-with-4.1-runtime-release-notes.adoc[Studio 7.1 release notes] for instructions and known issues. +

Studio 7.1 only supports Mule 4.x projects. The structure of the project, export format, XML and scripting language are different. +
Users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. See the Mule migration guide for more information.

Workspaces created using Anypoint Studio 6.x or below are not compatible with Anypoint Studio 7 workspaces.

From version 7.1.1 there is no special migration needed. When opening a previous Workspace which has projects that were created with Studio 7.1.0, and metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.


== JIRA Ticket List for Anypoint Studio

=== Known Issues

* Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7.1: Custom Policies, API Sync, Anypoint Private Cloud.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. +
Follow the xref:7.1@studio::faq-default-browser-config.adoc[FAQ: Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more details.

+
** *At Workspace level*: By clicking *Preferences*, *Validation*, and disabling "Manual" and "Build" checkbox for *XML Schema Validator* and *XML Validator*.
** *At Project level*: By righ-clicking on your project in your Package Explorer View, select *Properties*, *Validation*, and disabling "Manual" and "Build" checkbox for *XML Schema Validator* and *XML Validator*.
