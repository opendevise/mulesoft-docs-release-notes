== What's New

This release continues to strengthen Studio’s support for composing APIs.  This new release includes improved support for RAML 1.0 and enhanced user experience around API design sync feature between API Designer and Studio based on user feedback. This release also includes the beta release of composing and running API custom policies inside Studio.

* *Improved RAML 1.0 Support*: RAML editor embedded in Studio now has improved auto-completion and implements fully compliant RAML 1.0 validation. We have also enabled DataSense support for JSON and XML data types specified with RAML 1.0.
* *API Sync Enhancement*: we have made several changes to improve user experience
** Now, in addition to upload, download, refresh and compare, users can connect and disconnect local projects to an API hosted on API Designer
** Defined behaviors in team-sharing scenarios are documented xref:6@studio::api-sync-reference.adoc#sync-your-api-definition-with-multiple-projects[here].
* *API Custom Policy Support in Studio (public Beta)*: To make policies first-class citizen on Anypoint Platform, we are building various functional support to help users compose API custom policies and test them in Studio. We aim to add GUI support and other features to make policy composition as easy as building a Mule application in the future. In this release, we are packaging the basic policy development support as beta^<<footnote1,1>>^:
** Project wizard for starting a custom policy project
** Edit YAML/XML files to define a policy with auto-completion and validation support
** Configure parameters and attach policies to APIs within Studio
** Run API custom policies locally in Studio and use API Console to debug
+
For users who would like to try out this beta feature and help us shape the future roadmap around custom policy development support, you can accept the “beta testing terms” when starting a new “API Custom Policy Project” and send your feedback to us through beta@mulesoft.com.

[NOTE]
--
Beta status in this release indicates the functionality is open for customers to trial for the purpose of learning the new functionality and/or testing functionality in a non-production environment. Basic functionalities to enable core use cases are complete, and MuleSoft is in the process of verifying design and evolving feature completeness. There is no SLA or technical support obligations for the Beta features. Beta releases are suitable for use in test environments or for limited-use tests.  Please see our https://www.mulesoft.com/legal/product-trial-commercialfree-licenses[beta trial license] for full terms of use.

In addition to these API-related functionalities inside Studio, the new version of MUnit incorporates many significant improvements, including:

* Improved auto test generation support forto RAML
** Leveraging more RAML specs in scaffolding tests (e.g. header, query parameters)
** Improved test generation adding more cases per resource definition based on request type, response code and response type
** Support for traits
** Basic Payload generation based in JSON-Schemas
** Creating and referencing example data files based on RAML in MUnit tests
* Ignore / enable tests in suites
* Bug fixes and general improvements on coverage reports and Domain Support
* Improved on-boarding UX to use MUnit without requiring admin role on Windows

[NOTE]

If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a Mac computer with OS X that has no Java installed, the OS may require that you first download and install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6]. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.

[NOTE]

If you are running McAfee VirusScan on your Windows OS, Eclipse-based Anypoint Studio may experience negative performance impacts. McAfee has suggested the following remedy https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB58727[options].

== Known Issues

* Studio 6.1 does not support the following Mule 3.8 features:
** RecordVars and record payload should be editable in a commit block.
** Object Store support gaps around Idempotent Redelivery Policy, Aggregators and DevKit token manage
* Create JSON metadata from example does not support Big Integers
* When importing a zipped project related to the API Gateway's default domain (for example, proxies generated from API Platform), if the domain project does not exist in the workspace already, there is a chance that it will be generated incorrectly, resulting in an entry in the Package Explorer like "api-gateway_2_0_3 : ". The workaround is to delete the corrupt domain project and right click in the imported project -> Mule -> Associate with API Gateway domain, until the project is generated correctly displaying, for example, "api-gateway_2_0_3 : api-gateway".
* When changing API Platform environments from production to another environment, Studio would try to update offline projects, showing connection error marker. The workaround is to use different workspaces for each environment so that there will no be problem with users authentication.
* Folder decorators are not being shown correctly when users eliminate them. It shows them as modified and not as eliminated.
* When creating a new project with an invalid raml zip, Studio does not copy those files to the workspace.
* API Custom Policy Editing is a beta feature. We have a few known gaps, some of which will be addressed in the future based on customer feedback, including: debugging and MUnit support, Maven support, support to YAML all field types such as key-values and arrays (currently supporting String, Boolean, Int, Expression, and IPAddresses), and support for import/export from Exchange and API Manager.



[[migration]]
== Migration Guide

Users running Studio 6.0 can update to this new version directly from the Studio xref:6@studio::studio-update-sites.adoc[Update Site]. +
If you are running an older version than Studio 6.0, you need to download a new full copy in order to update.

When opening a previous Workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.

[TIP]
====
You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

image::studio/import-extensions.png[import]

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
====

== Eclipse Plugin

If you are using Studio as an Eclipse plugin, you can get this version of Studio using the Eclipse update site `+http://studio.mulesoft.org/r5/plugin+`.

This allows you to download Anypoint Studio core and third-party components version 6.x.x and with an embedded version of Mule Runtime v3.8.x along with other optional components. +
For a detailed description of the update site's content visit the xref:6@studio::studio-in-eclipse.adoc#available-software-in-the-update-site[Studio in Eclipse] section.
