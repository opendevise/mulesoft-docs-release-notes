== Known Issues

* [MULE-11258] -  DataWeave: reader properties can only be configured in the script using the input directive and not through the UI, this is needed to read any Flat File format (Flat File, Fixed Width, Copybook, CSV)
* [STUDIO-9901 MULE-1359] - Environment Variables to define properties files are not supported
* [STUDIO-959] - DataSense does not work for connectors not shipped with Studio
* [STUDIO-9845] - DataSense: imported files inside schema definitions are not being copied inside the project
* [STUDIO-935] - DataSense: Metadata: json schemas with import do not work unless they have a full path
* [MULE-12734] -  Some extensions return false positive when doing Test Connection
* [STUDIO-9916] - Metadata propagation not supported when using Object as Datasource for Database Config
* [STUDIO-9436] - Metadata: can not create XML types from samples that contains CDATA
* [STUDIO-954] - Dependencies are not refreshed properly if the pom is updated while the dependencies are being resolved.

* To be able to deploy a project which uses the runtime 4.0.0 into Cloudhub you need to have certain permissions in your Anypoint Platform user to see runtime 4.0.0 when deploying it.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a  Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. See the xref:7.1@studio::faq-default-browser-config.adoc[docs around this topic] for more information.
* [STUDIO-9684] - Menu items get grayed out after opening Exchange using XulRunner
* [MULE-11437] -  Mule modules needs to provide icons, today many of the modules have the generic icon.
* [MULE-12859] - XML Metadata is not generated correctly when the provided sample has namespaces.
* [STUDIO-938] - Validation error when required attribute is written with double quotes in a Choice expression.
* [STUDIO-970] - Debugger: payload shown while debugging is partial but there is no notification to the user or way to view the rest of the payload
* [STUDIO-990] - Problems when Studio starts with Java 8 but tries to start the Tooling instance with Java 7

* [STUDIO-871] - Mule plugins with snapshot versions should always be regenerated.
* [STUDIO-995] - Metadata propagation error when not setting Config on "HTTP Request”.

== Migration Guide

Studio 7 only supports Mule 4 projects. The structure of the project, export format, XML and scripting language are different. For the beta, users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. See the Mule migration guide for more information.
