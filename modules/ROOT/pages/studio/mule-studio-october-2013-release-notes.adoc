October 4, 2013

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of **Mule Studio (October 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013)**.

Our new version of Studio functions as a single download with two runtimes:

* Mule 3.4.1 Enterprise Runtime - available for deployment on premises and to CloudHub
* CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013) - available for deployment to CloudHub

These release notes apply to Mule Studio (October 2013) and the CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013). Note that the new features and functionality described here are only available for deployment in CloudHub using the CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013). If you intend to deploy your application to an on-premise production server, use a Mule 3.4.1 runtime when you begin a new project in Mule Studio. Access link:/mule-user-guide/v/3.4/[Mule 3.4 documentation] for details.
[TIP]
Refer to our Release Strategy for full details about our most recently released runtimes and their deployment options.

== New Features and Functionality

* **xref:5@studio::datasense-query-editor.adoc[DataSense Query Editor Improvements:] *Even more connectors support* **Studio's graphical query editor. Further, the query editor itself now supports syntax highlighting, nested fields, and advanced filtering options.
* xref:3.7@mule-runtime::auto-paging-in-anypoint-connectors.adoc[*Auto-Paging Support for Anypoint Connectors:*] Selected connectors now support pagination of output to prevent memory issues.
* *DevKit Support for DataSense-enabled Connectors and Auto-Paging:* You can now enable DataSense support and auto-paging on any connector that you build with DevKit.
* *DataMapper Runtime Performance Improvement:* Improvements to the DataMapper runtime mean better runtime performance when working with tree-structured data formats such as XML, map, JSON and POJO. Further, the new in-memory cache property enables fast and performant memory caches in order to speed up the task of generating data structures.
* xref:3.7@mule-runtime::poll-reference.adoc[*Simplified Poll Debugging:*] Studio's Visual Debugger now offers the ability to pause and resume polling in debug mode to improve the user experience while testing and debugging with polls.
* *Improved Environment Management in CloudHub:* CloudHub administrators can now move applications between environments.
* *Anypoint Service Registry Service Autodiscovery:* You can now configure your Mule Studio applications to be automatically registered by the Anypoint agent to your Anypoint Service Registry account.
* *Anypoint Connectors Compatibility:* The majority of connectors available on MuleSoft's http://www.mulesoft.org/connectors[Anypoint Connectors website] are compatible with CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013), although not all connectors support DataSense. Refer to the complete list of xref:5@studio::using-perceptive-flow-design.adoc[DataSense-enabled] connectors.
* *SAP Transport*: version 2.2.0 supports DataSense.


== Hardware and Software System Requirements

For most use cases, Mule Studio (October 2013) does not change the hardware and software system requirements established by Mule 3.4.1. Please https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[contact MuleSoft Support] with any questions you may have about system requirements.

== Important Notes and Known Issues in this Release

This list covers some of the known issues with Mule Studio (October 2013) with CloudHub Mule Runtime (October 2013). Please read this list before reporting any issues you may have spotted.

=== Mule ESB

[%autowidth.spread]
|===
|MULE-7029 |Several exceptions thrown when pooling in the objectstore

=== Mule Studio

[cols="2*"]
|===
|STUDIO-3786 a|
Cannot cancel metadata retrieval in DataSense when incorrect credentials provided in the connector configuration.

*Workaround*: Cancel or fail three times, then the operation will cancel, giving you an opportunity to correct the incorrect credentials.

|STUDIO-3848 |Properties placeholders do not work for DataSense with ESB 3.4.X runtimes.
|STUDIO-3837 |Attempting to maximize the properties editor causes a blank screen and any configuration to be lost.
|STUDIO-3831 a|
In imported projects including both JDBC and a 3.5 connector in the classpath, connection testing will not work in the 3.4.1 runtime.

*Workaround*: Remove the 3.5 connector from the classpath.

|STUDIO-3849 |When editing the build path of the project, changes are not always reflected consistently.
|STUDIO-3516 |Issues with the response arrow when using Composite Source.

== Migrating from Mule Studio Andes to Mule Studio (October 2013)

[NOTE]
It is recommended that you create a **new workspace in Mule Studio (October 2013)**, then import any existing projects into your new workspace.

* With Mule Studio October 2013, the ObjectStore interface adds a new clear() method that empties the contents of an object store without disposing of it. In case of persistent object store, the actual files backing the content are deleted. In case of transient object stores, the reference to the items are severed. The ObjectStoreManager's dispose() method should first delegate into the store's clear method and then dispose() it if necessary.
* With Mule Studio October 2013, the QueueManager interface includes a clear() method that empties the queue. In case of persistent object store, the actual files backing the content are deleted. In case of transient object stores, the reference to the items will be severed. ObjectStoreManager's dispose() method should first delegate into the store's clear method and then dispose() it if necessary.

For more details on how to migrate from previous versions of Mule Studio, access the migration guide embedded within the release notes for previous versions of Mule, or the xref:deprecated/legacy-mule-migration-notes.adoc[library of legacy Migration Guides].

== Third Party Extensions

At this time, not all of the third party extensions you may have been using with previous versions of Mule ESB have been upgraded to work with Mule Studio (October 2013). https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[Contact MuleSoft Support] if you have a question about a specific module.
