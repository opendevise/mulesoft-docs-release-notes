== What's New

This release incorporates major improvements around Studio’s support for the API development lifecycle, incorporating more seamless integration between Studio and API Designer, expanding support for APIkit, and unifies the API Gateway runtime with the core Mule runtime. These capabilities include:

* Seamlessly navigate between API designer and Studio by synchronizing (pull, push, compare) your APIs
* Ability to register your APIs in API Manager from within Studio
* Ability to select an API from API Manager to implement from within Studio
* Support for SOAP APIs in APIkit
* An enhanced New Project wizard which supports both REST and SOAP API implementation
* Browse for WSDLs and RAMLs in Exchange to consume APIs in HTTP and WS Consumer
* An Early-Access version of RAML 1.0 support to help users explore newly-released RAML 1.0 features and create / edit API definitions and implement flows using APIkit

In addition to these API-related functionalities, Studio also includes many other improvements:

* More detailed data for debugging on some connectors, such as HTTP and Database
* Improved error messages, which allow you to clearly see where the error is coming from and click to navigate to that point in the flow
* DataWeave now includes supports for new file formats, allowing you to read and write fixed-width and other flat files using DataWeave. The structure of these files can be easily defined via a new xref:3.8@mule-runtime::dataweave-flat-file-schemas.adoc[Flat File Definition file] format. You can also import COBOL Copybook files into this schema format using Studio (Early Access). Finally, if you have previous DataMapper transformations, you can use the xref:3.8@mule-runtime::dataweave-migrator.adoc[migration tool] to convert them to DataWeave transformations now.
* The xref:3.8@mule-runtime::dataweave-language-introduction.adoc[DataWeave language] also adds several new xref:3.8@mule-runtime::dataweave-operators.adoc[operators].
* DataWeave functions can now be called from other Mule components via a second MEL function, called xref:3.8@mule-runtime::mel-dataweave-functions.adoc#split[split].
* MUnit now can run multiple suites, and allow link:/munit/v/1.2.0/using-munit-in-anypoint-studio#running-a-tests-inside-a-folder[nested folders for tests]. Users can also now create MUnit link:/munit/v/1.2.0/munit-maven-support#coverage[coverage reports from inside Studio]. We have also added autocompletion support for MUnit’s MEL functions and metadata support to MUnit message processors
* Metadata support to MUnit message processors

SAP R/3 Business Suite Connector v3.0.0:

* Support of MEL expressions to define JCo Client Extended Properties.
* Enhancement of DataSense to display additional information. For Functions and BAPIs, it is now possible to identify tables and structures, optional and required fields, the 'real' data type  associated with them (such as Char, Number), their length and a description. For IDocs, segments are also clearly labeled.

This release also provides support for all the new capabilities in Mule 3.8, which are found in the xref:mule-runtime/mule-3.8.0-release-notes.adoc[Mule 3.8 release notes].

[NOTE]
--
If you are installing Anypoint Studio on a Mac computer with OS X that has no Java installed, the OS may require that you first download and install http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase6-419409.html[JDK 1.6]. Install JDK 1.6 first and then install JDK 1.7.

[NOTE]
--
If you are running McAfee VirusScan on your Windows OS, Eclipse-based Anypoint Studio may experience negative performance impacts. McAfee has suggested the following remedy https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=KB58727[options].

== Known Issues

* Early-Access support to RAML 1.0 is meant for our customers to explore the newly released RAML 1.0 specification. RAML 1.0 Early-Access support gaps for MuleSoft products are documented xref:platform/raml-1-early-access-support.adoc[here]
* When running an MUnit test over Windows without admin right,  you may find a `could not load library jansi` error. This is due to jar file that log4j uses that tries to use this dll library and if it can not find it then it tries to create it under `java.io.tmpdir` system property. +
If the user do not have write permissions to that directory which Windows always returns as `C:\Windows` it will fail. The workaround is to overwrite that property in the lunch configuration: +
`Djava.io.tmpdir=D:\Users\myUserName` or run Studio as an Administrator
* Studio 6.0 does not support the following Mule 3.8 features: +
** RecordVars and record payload should be editable in a commit block.
** Object Store support gaps around Idempotent Redelivery Policy, Aggregators and DevKit token manage.
* Create JSON metadata from example does not support Big Integers
* When importing a zipped project related to the API Gateway's default domain (for example, proxies generated from API Platform), if the domain project does not exist in the workspace already, there is a chance that it will be generated incorrectly, resulting in an entry in the Package Explorer like `api-gateway_2_0_3 : `. +
The workaround is to delete the corrupt domain project and right click in the imported project -> *Mule* -> *Associate with API Gateway domain*, until the project is generated correctly displaying, for example, `api-gateway_2_0_3 : api-gateway`.
* When changing API Platform environments from production to another environment, Studio would try to update offline projects, showing connection error marker. The workaround is to use different workspaces for each environment so that there will no be problem with users authentication.
* In the API Sync View, when clicking on _refresh_ option and having selected one project, the expected behavior is to refresh only that project, However, it is refreshing all projects.
* When uploading an entire API from Studio, it takes more than one automatic synchronization job to see files and folders decorators correctly.
* Folder decorators are not being shown correctly when users eliminate them. It shows them as modified and not as eliminated.
* When creating a new project with an invalid raml zip, Studio does not copy those files to the workspace.


[[migration]]
== Migration Guide

From the previous versions of Studio 5.1.0, 5.1.1, 5.2.0, 5.2.1, 5.3.0, 5.4.1, 5.4.2 and 5.4.3, there is no special migration needed, but when opening a previous workspace with projects that were created with Studio 5.1.0 or older, and which has metadata stored in disk, Studio asks you to perform an update to all the projects so that the Metadata Manager can handle the types and to show the types in your project.


[TIP]
====
If you are migrating from Studio 5.x to Studio 6, *you need to perform a clean install of Studio* . +

You can easily import all of the external components that you had installed in your old version of Anypoint Studio through a single action. This includes connectors, runtimes, and any other type of extension added through the Anypoint Exchange or the ​*Help -> Install new software*​ menu, as long as there are no compatibility restrictions.

Do this by selecting *File->Import* and then choose *Install->From existing installation*.

image::studio/import-extensions.png[import]

Then specify the location of your old version of Anypoint Studio in your local drive.
====

== Eclipse Plugin

If you are using Studio as an Eclipse plugin, you can get this version of Studio using the Eclipse update site `+http://studio.mulesoft.org/r5/plugin+`.

This allows you to download Anypoint Studio core and third-party components version 6.x.x and with an embedded version of Mule Runtime v3.8.x along with other optional components. +
For a detailed description of the update site's content visit the xref:6@studio::studio-in-eclipse.adoc#available-software-in-the-update-site[Studio in Eclipse] section.
