== Known Issues

* DataWeave editor does not support regex as function parameters STUDIO-9069
* Metadata: can not create XML types from samples that contains CDATA STUDIO-9436
* Application-types file is not updated when deleting MP from XML view. STUDIO-9505
* Metadata tree is not being updated for Flows. STUDIO-9522
* Dependencies are not refreshed properly if the pom is updated while the dependencies are being resolved.STUDIO-9540
* APIKit does not support metadata
* First time you create a MUnit test from a Flow you get a message saying that you have to wait for the dependencies to be added to the project and then try again. +
Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7: Domains, Custom Policies, APISync, Anypoint Private Cloud, Gateway runtime connectivity.
* To be able to deploy a project which uses the runtime 4.0.0 into Cloudhub you need to have certain permissions in your Anypoint Platform user to see runtime 4.0.0 when deploying it.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. See xref:7.1@studio::faq-default-browser-config.adoc[Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more information.
* Mule modules needs to provide icons, today many of the modules have the generic icon. MULE-11437
* XML Metadata is not generated correctly when the provided sample has namespaces. MULE-12859
* Validation error when required attribute is written with double quotes in a Choice expression. STUDIO-9386
* Generated UI in Mule properties editors for Modules that use Map<String,List<String>> type of structures such as MongoDB will not work. STUDIO-9570
* Includes are not resolved correctly when creating a new apikit project.  STUDIO-9573
* Running application "Pom.xml" is not updated when changing dependencies. STUDIO-9148
* Mule plugins with snapshot versions should always be regenerated.STUDIO-8716
* DataSense does not work for connectors not shipped with Studio. STUDIO-9591

== Migration Guide

Studio 7 only supports Mule 4 projects. The structure of the project, export format, XML and scripting language are different. For the beta, users must migrate Mule 3 projects to Mule 4 manually, before they can be used in Studio 7. Please see the Mule migration guide for more information.
