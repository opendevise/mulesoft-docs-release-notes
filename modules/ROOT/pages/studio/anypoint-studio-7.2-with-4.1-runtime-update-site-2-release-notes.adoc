Projects created or updated with Studio 7.2.x are not compatible with 7.1.x due to some improvements with the management of the mule-artifcat.json file. The content of the file was reduced and part of the content used to be required by Studio 7.1.x. +
To fix this issue you only need to update Studio to the latest 7.2.x version available. See xref:7.2@studio::update-workspace.adoc[Updating Workspaces] for more information.

== Known Issues

* Studio 7.2.2 only supports Mule 4.x projects. Due to the structure of projects, export format, xml and scripting language differences, we do not offer backwards compatibility with Mule 3.x runtimes.
* Some existing features in Studio 6.x are not yet supported in Studio 7: Custom Policies, API Sync, Anypoint Private Cloud.
* Anypoint Studio uses your configured default browser to display web content such as Exchange and the Runtime Manager UI when deploying an application to Anypoint Platform. If your default internet browser does not display this content correctly, you can configure Anypoint Studio to use a Mozilla/XULRunner runtime environment as the underlying renderer for the Web UI. +
Follow the xref:7.1@studio::faq-default-browser-config.adoc[FAQ: Troubleshooting Issues with Your Default OS Browser] for more details.
