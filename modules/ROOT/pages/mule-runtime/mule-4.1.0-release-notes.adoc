Mule 4.1 is the second Early Access Program release, not only incorporating feedback from the program’s participants, but also adding lots of new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.

Mule Runtime 4.1.0 includes the following enhancements, changes, and fixes.

== New Features and Enhancements

=== Core Runtime

* Lots of performance improvements and enhancements of the new reactive engine
* Enhancements in the Tooling API to better support Studio and Flow Designer
* Dynamic evaluator component to support dynamic expressions
* Library upgrades: now we use Log4j 2.10 and CXF 3.2.1
* Transparent capacity overload handling on all message sources, even those released in 4.0

=== SDK

* Support for defining custom capacity overload strategies.
* Support for emitting notifications
* Support for inbound/outbound correlation ids
* Support for Cluster Aware message sources
* Support for new automatic triggers like "On updated Salesforce Object" or "On new or updated file".
* Improved support for Routers
* Support for connectivity testing in SOAP connectors
* Many bug fixes

This release is supported on Anypoint Private Cloud Edition 1.6.1 and later.

=== API Gateway Features and Enhancements

In this version, the focus is resilience, security, and troubleshooting ease.

* Logs were enriched to enable an easier tracing of errors. In particular, in this release, a mechanism is implemented to allow for viewing the whole trip of a request as it goes through all applied policies to a resource, by specifying on the log4j configuration the package `org.mule.runtime.core.internal.policy` to trace level. Note: Trace level is not currently supported in CloudHub.

* SSL verification for Runtime: API Platform communications is now enabled by default. This means that self-signed certificates, revoked or expired ones belonging to a connected proxy and/or Private Cloud system, will not be accepted. To disable this feature, specify `anypoint.platform.enable_ssl_validation=false`.

* NTLM proxy is now supported, and the proxy basic authentication mechanism is fixed. Note: Deployed applications that need to go through a proxy must use another mechanism. This mechanism applies exclusively to the Runtime - API Platform communication.

* Gatekeeper default mode is now “Flexible”, which is a tradeoff between blocking security and disaster recovery mitigation.

* Introducing a new policy: Spike Control. This policy replaces the former Throttling policy. The policy will be used to smooth network traffic.

* Developer experience improved when creating a custom policy: Clearer and more compact way to develop a custom policy than in v4.0.0.

* This version includes support for Analytics processing through Anypoint Runtime Manager (which is an existing feature not enabled in v4.0.0). This allows for setting third-party systems such as Splunk to consume Analytics info.
