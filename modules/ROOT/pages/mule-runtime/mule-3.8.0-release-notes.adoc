*May 16, 2016*

MuleSoft is pleased to announce the release of Mule 3.8.0, containing significant new features and functionality. This release has a <<known-issue,known issue>> related to the on-premises use of analytics, which requires the workaround described in this document.

== New Features and Functionality

Mule 3.8.0 has the following new features and functions.

=== Unified API Gateway and Mule Runtimes

This release unifies the https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/api-gateway-runtime-archive[API Gateway runtime] with the core Mule runtime, simplifying development and operations. See the xref:api-gateway/api-gateway-runtime-to-mule-3.8.0-migration-guide.adoc[migration guide] for information about how to migrate.

=== Early Access RAML 1.0

This release includes Early Access xref:apikit/apikit-3.8.0-release-notes.adoc[RAML 1.0 in APIkit]. RAML 1.0 includes many productivity enhancements, such as a new data type definition, support for multiple examples, and improved security schemes.

=== HTTP Requester DNS Improvements

Using the HTTP connector to connect to an API, the connector now resolves all IP addresses for the DNS record. The connector then distributes connections across all IPs. If a connection error occurs for one IP, the next one is tried transparently. This simple DNS round robin load balancing across the returned host addresses improves resiliency and load distribution.

=== TLS Improvements

xref:3.8@mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc[TLS context] can be shared in a xref:3.8@mule-runtime::shared-resources.adoc[domain]. The cipher suite and protocol configuration is allowed at a connector level. TLS 1.0 is now disabled by default and there is a new "insecure" mode for local testing that doesn’t perform certificate validation. Also, the tls-default configuration is now used for the communication with API Manager.

=== DataWeave Fixed Width, Flat File, and COBOL Copybook

DataWeave now includes supports for new file formats for reading and writing fixed-width and other flat files using DataWeave. The structure of these files can be easily defined using a new Flat File Definition file format. You can also import COBOL Copybook files into this schema format using Studio (Early Access). Finally, you can now use the migration tool to convert DataMapper transformations to DataWeave transformations.


=== Mule HA Quorums and Persistent Storage

Mule HA includes a number of new improvements. First, it contains a new xref:3.8@mule-runtime::creating-and-managing-a-cluster-manually.adoc#quorum-management[quorum feature], which allows you to specify the minimum number of Mule instances to function. This allows you to more effectively deal with network splits in a cloud environment, such as AWS and Azure. Mule HA also includes a xref:3.8@mule-runtime::creating-and-managing-a-cluster-manually.adoc#object-store-persistence[persistence option] for storing ObjectStore data in a database. This improves resilience and allows you to create backups for recovery situations. Finally, it is now possible to xref:3.8@mule-runtime::creating-and-managing-a-cluster-manually.adoc#monitoring[monitor cluster members via JMX].

=== Client ID Enforcement Policy with Basic Authentication

This release introduces an improvement in the link:/api-manager/client-id-based-policies#client-id-enforcement[Client ID enforcement] policy, an option to use Basic Authentication as a way to provide the client credentials. The default configuration of the policy remains to provide the Client Id and Client Secret expressions, but there is a new option to select the HTTP Basic Authorization Header as the origin of the credentials. This option is available only in Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and later.

=== Gatekeeper: Enhanced Security on Startup

As a security improvement in this release, a managed API is disabled until all its online policies are successfully applied. This translates to an API returning 503 (Service Unavailable) status code until the runtime can communicate and retrieve the list of applicable policies for an API and has successfully applied them.

This functionality is enabled by default and configurable through a property named "anypoint.platform.gatekeeper".

IMPORTANT: The gatekeeper feature is available only on standalone instances. Cluster support will be addressed in a future release.

=== Policy Order Improvements

Gateway 2.2.0 introduced the capability to order the policies. In this release, the feature is enhanced to support more granularity and enable the configuration of a different order value on the policy's before and after blocks.

This feature enables more flexibility to order a policy that contains logic in the before and after flow. The order defined on the before and after elements will take precedence over the value configured at the policy level.

For more information about a custom policy configuration, see https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/applying-custom-policies[Applying Custom Policies].

=== Support for X-Forwarded-For Headers

The auto-generated proxies in this release support handling the X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Host headers. This behavior is enabled by default, but it can be disabled by setting the "x_forwarded_headers_propagation" property to false or by applying the https://www.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/?search=Remove%20Request%20Headers%20Policy[Remove Request Headers Policy].

=== Persistence of Throttling and Rate Limiting Quota

In this release, the throttling and rate limiting policies support persisting the quota. On a standalone instance, this behavior is enabled by default, and the time elapsed between each dump of the quota state to disk can be configured by setting the property named "throttling.persistent_data_update_freq". T, the time, is expressed in seconds and the default is 10 seconds.

This functionality can be disabled by configuring the property "throttling.persistence_enabled".

IMPORTANT: Persistence is only available for standalone instances. CloudHub and Cluster support will be addressed in a future release.

=== Other Improvements

This release also contains many other improvements:

* Improved troubleshooting messages, so that you can see the location of any errors in the flow and you receive better error messages for common problems.
* Support for non-blocking to JMS outbound request response endpoint
* Additional tuning parameters for batch processing
* The BatchJobInstance ID and Batch block size are now configurable
* Users can now specify custom log4j2 config locations
* Domains now support loader overrides and redeployment control
* Timezone can now be specified in the <poll> scheduler and Quartz connector
* Support for specifying query timeout for database connector operations
* SFTP now validates againsts the known_hosts files
* Improved DataWeave documentation, quickstart guide, and examples
* Enhanced security on startup
* The runtime now contains a script to generate API Gateway domain

== Supported Software

Mule was tested on the following software:

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Software |Version
|JDK |JRE 1.7.0, JRE 1.8.0 (Recommended JRE 1.8.0_91/92)
|OS |MacOS 10.11.4, HP-UX 11i V3, AIX 7.2, Windows 2012 R2 Server, Windows 8.1, Solaris 11.3, RHEL 7, Ubuntu Server 15.04
|Application Servers |Tomcat 7, Tomcat 8, WebLogic 12c, WildFly 8, WildFly 9, WebSphere 8, Jetty 8, Jetty 9
|Databases |Oracle 11g, Oracle 12c, MySQL 5.5+, DB2 10, PostgreSQL 9, Derby 10, Microsoft SQL Server 2014
|===

API Gateway is compatible with the following software:

* APIkit 3.8.0
* Anypoint Studio 6.0.0


== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule runtime comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 1.4.1.

See xref:runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].

== Migration Guide

This runtime uses xref:dataweave/dataweave-1.0.2-release-notes.adoc[DataWeave version 1.0.2], if you have any DataWeave transformations on your code, check its corresponding migration guide.

=== API Gateway 1.3.x and 2.x Migration to Mule 3.8.0

As a result of the unification of API Gateway Runtime with Mule Runtime 3.8.0 and several usability issues reported in previous Gateway versions, the default API Gateway domain is no longer bundled with the distribution. If you want to use the domain for sharing resources as you did with the previous release, follow the xref:api-gateway/api-gateway-runtime-to-mule-3.8.0-migration-guide.adoc[migration procedure] for creating a domain in Mule 3.8.0.

=== General Considerations

When changing Mule versions
the best alternative is to download and install the new version on a separate machine (or VM) and the move their applications. I.e, repeat the installation and deployment process.

== Known Issue

CHHYBRID-1727
Mule Runtime 3.8.0 on-premises analytics does not work due to a bug in the Runtime Manager Agent 1.4.1 which is shipped with Mule 3.8. The workaround is to run the xref:api-gateway/api-gateway-runtime-to-mule-3.8.0-migration-guide.adoc#syntax[gateway_domain_setup] script even if your application does not use a domain.

== Community Edition Migration to Mule 3.8.0

When migrating to Mule 3.8.0, follow the implicit and explicit guidelines related to these issues:

[%header,cols="25a,75a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
|MULE-6298 |AbstractMessageSequenceSplitter#process will now return null instead of a VoidMuleEvent. This affects only the scenario where the elements of a split collection are filtered out.
|MULE-8626 |The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Connection" outbound property when responding to a request (listener) or making one (request), instead of transforming it to a header. This means that if such a property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a response/request builder.
|MULE-8676 |The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Transfer-Encoding" outbound property when sending a response instead of transforming it to a header. This means that if such a property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a response builder.
|MULE-8677 |The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Transfer-Encoding" outbound property when making a request instead of transforming it to a header. This means that if such a property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a request builder.
|MULE-8678 |The HTTP Connector will now ignore a "Host" outbound property when making a request instead of transforming it to a header. This means that if such a property is desired, it should be explicitly added as a header using a request builder.
|MULE-8844 |When until-successful throws an exception, it will now be a RetryPolicyExhaustedException wrapping the cause of the exception of the last try instead of a MessagingException wrapping a RetryPolicyExhaustedException with no link to the actual cause.
|MULE-8927 |The attributes that end in an endpoint URI (for instance smtp user and passwords) had to be encoded as a workaround for this issue. That workaround now has to be removed. This also affects the result of MEL expressions (for instance, if an expression evaluated to a username with an @ char, it had to be encoded before using it), so a check has to be done to remove all the additional encoding that was put in place for this workaround.
|MULE-8963 |Exceptions that extend org.mule.api.MessagingException now receive the org.mule.api.processor.MessageProcessor that was executing in the constructor.
|MULE-9041 |The HTTP Connector will leave the inbound property http.remote.address with the actual remote address. If an X-Forwarded-For header is present, it will be available as an inbound property.
|MULE-9044 |The HTTP Listener will now return a 400 instead of a 500 when an invalid Content-Type is sent on a request. Additionally, in both cases a response body will be present.
|MULE-9149 |mule-module-jbpm was removed from standalone and embedded CE distributions. The following libraries were also removed as they are not required anymore: hibernate-commons-annotations-3.2.0.Final.jar, hibernate-core-3.6.0.Final.jar, hibernate-jpa-2.0-api-1.0.0.Final.jar, jbpm-api-4.4.jar, jbpm-jpdl-4.4.jar, jbpm-log-4.4.jar, jbpm-pvm-4.4.jar, juel-engine-2.1.0.jar, juel-impl-2.2.1.jar, livetribe-jsr223-2.0.5.jar
|MULE-9183 |Status code for successful one-way operations handled through CXF will be 202 instead of 200.
|MULE-9204 |The default authentication method for a token request when using the oauth client credentials grant type will now be basic auth (using client id as user and client secret as password). If the previous authentication method is desired instead, then the "encodeCredentialsInBody" attribute of the token-request element should be set to "true".
|MULE-9306 |Losing flow and session variables when using MuleClient to dispatch/send an event. Exception strategy not caching exceptions after using MuleClient on a JavaComponent.
|MULE-9324 |When using a File inbound endpoint to poll a directory, an exception will be thrown if the directory to be polled doesn't exist. That exception will be handled by the System Exception Strategy.
|MULE-9334 |When an SQLException occurs while executing a query, all ResultSets from that DB connection (i.e. multiple queries in the same transaction) that remain open will be closed.
|MULE-9337 |TLSv1 is no longer listed as an enabled protocol, by default only TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 will be enabled. If you want to use TLSv1 you can edit the TLS configuration file (tls-default.conf) and add it back to the enabled protocols entry.
|MULE-9368 |System property mule.sftp.knownHostsFile is now removed. Instead, the file with the known hosts must now be provided through the mule XML config file in the knownHostsFile attribute of the connector or the endpoints.
|MULE-9383 |HTTP Connector will allow invalid Content-Type header values. In order to strictly validate them as before, use the mule.strictContentType=true system property.
|MULE-9405 |MuleException instead of NPE is now thrown when setting a null value for a context-property in an XstlTransformation.
|MULE-9501 |The wildcard-filter will only work with prefix (*.log), suffix (java.util.*) or enclosing strings (*util*) patterns, as well as the deprecated payload based filter (java.lang.Throwable+) and regular strings.In any other case no match will be possible, regardless of the input. The regex-filter should be used for other cases. This also affects the wildcard patterns allowed by the file-wildcard-filter, request-wildcard-filter, expression-filter, message-property-filter, exceptions strategies commit-transaction and rollback transaction exception patterns, wildcard patterns used in expressions, and more (a complete list can be found in https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/MULE-9501).
|MULE-9533 |JMS Outbound endpoint does not respect response timeout.  Because the JMS outbound endpoint now uses the endpoint 'responseTimeout' attribute, it will no longer respect any timeout value set directly on the MuleEvent via the API.  To mitigate this, configure the desired timeout via the 'responseTimeout' attribute on the endpoint element.

|Issue |Description
|EE-4561 |mule-module-jbpm was removed from standalone and embedded EE distributions. The following libraries were also removed as they are not required anymore: hibernate-commons-annotations-3.2.0.Final.jar, hibernate-core-3.6.0.Final.jar, hibernate-jpa-2.0-api-1.0.0.Final.jar, jbpm-api-4.4.jar, jbpm-jpdl-4.4.jar, jbpm-log-4.4.jar, jbpm-pvm-4.4.jar, juel-engine-2.1.0.jar, juel-impl-2.2.1.jar, livetribe-jsr223-2.0.5.jar
|EE-4637 |Batch history expiration is no longer configured through system properties but through the new `<batch:history>` element
|EE-4916 |The Hazelcast library has been updated from version 3.1.6 to version 3.6.2 to support quorum for clusters. With this upgrade, it is not longer possible to configure TCP/IP node discovery at the same time as multicast. In previous configurations using both methods, disable one of them.

|Issue |Description
|EE-4724 |Upgrade Kryo to 3.0.3
