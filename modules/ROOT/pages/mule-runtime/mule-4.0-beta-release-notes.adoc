*June 26, 2017*

Mule 4 beta evolves Mule 3 significantly to enable developers to accomplish common tasks in fewer steps, learn fewer concepts to be successful, simplify upgrades, and support for new web based tools, such as the https://docs.mulesoft.com/design-center/v/1.0/[Flow Designer] in Design Center.

This initial release includes:

* Simplified Event and Message Model.
* DataWeave 2.0: the new Mule expression language.
* Simplified Connectors and Modules Experience.
* Simplified Error Handling and new Try Scope.
* Transparent streaming of payloads.
* Ability to enrich Events directly from connectors/modules.
* Self tuning, non blocking execution engine.
* Classloader Isolation for Mule runtime, Applications, and connectors.

For a detailed overview of what’s new in Mule 4, please see the xref:4.1@mule-runtime::mule-runtime-updates.adoc[What’s New in Mule 4 guide].

== DataWeave 2.0 New Features

The DataWeave language entirely replaces everything that Mule Expression Language does, as the default expression language in all Mule components. It has the following improvements over older versions of the language:

* Importing of external modules with custom and specialized functions.
* Block comments can be added over multiple lines.
* Improved error messages with call values and stacktrace.
* Type checking.
* Type inference, which makes typing optional.
* Various syntax changes.

// See link:/mule4-user-guide/v/4.1/dataweave2-syntax-changes[DataWeave 2.0 Syntax Changes] for a full list of these changes.
