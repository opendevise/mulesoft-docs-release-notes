Mule Runtime 3.8.6 includes enhancements, changes, and fixes.

This release is supported on Anypoint Private Cloud Edition 1.6.1 and later.

== Key Enhancements

Key Enhancements

* Local Analytics DataBase size can be specified. This is a security enhancement to avoid a possible system crash if analytics events, because of not being consumed, consumes all available system disk space.

* As part of disaster recovery initiative, Gatekeeper enhancements introduced in v3.9.0 are backported to this version. Gatekeeper default level is now “flexible”.

* Some fixes regarding ARM, performance, and recovery from lost connectivity scenarios.

* In this release, CORS module is upgraded to v2.1.3. HTTP Client is upgraded to v4.5.3 and Jackson library is upgraded to v2.9.2.

== Changes

* MULE-14169: Remove Drools module from distribution (check the Drools doc for details in case you need to use it: https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-user-guide/v/3.8/drools-module-reference)
