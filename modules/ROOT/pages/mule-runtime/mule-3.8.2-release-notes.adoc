Mule Runtime 3.8.2 fixes a number of issues to improve error handling and efficiency when deploying applications managed by policies.

== Supported Software

Mule was tested on the following software:

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]

|===

The unified Mule Runtime 3.8.2 and API Gateway is compatible with APIkit 3.8.2.

== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule runtime comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 1.5.2.

See xref:runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].


== Migration Guide

XML entity expansion in XML transformers is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behavior use the expandInternalEntities="true" attribute.

XML entity expansion in Jersey is now disabled by default because it allows DoS attacks. To restore previous behavior use the mule.xml.expandInternalEntities=true property.

Processing after a `synchronous until successful` resulting in a `VoidMuleEvent` will now continue with the original event.
