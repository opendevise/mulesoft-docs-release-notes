*November 19, 2017*

This is an Early Access release of Mule 4. We do not recommend that existing Mule customers migrate applications to Mule 4 at this time. This release is suitable for the following scenarios:

* Users of the Design Center web-based flow designer who are deploying on CloudHub, where this is a GA-supported release.
* Customers who are interested in testing upcoming enhancements to Mule Runtime.
* Partners and community who are updating their Mule connectors and other materials

== What’s new?
This release contains only bug fixes. See xref:4.1@mule-runtime::mule-runtime-updates.adoc[What’s New in Mule 4] for a complete overview of what’s included in Mule 4.

== Gateway 4
Gateway leverages many of the improvements added in Mule 4. See xref:4.1@mule-runtime::mule-runtime-updates.adoc[What’s New in Mule 4] for a complete overview.

* There is classloading isolation between the policies, the application and the runtime.
* Policies can be distributed outside of the runtime, providing frictionless upgrades
* All policies are non-blocking.
* All policies can be ordered. The only policy with a fixed order is CORS that it is executed first.
* Resource-level policy support has been extended to any HTTP API and not restricted to RAML based APIs.
* Custom policies can leverage Mule core concepts and language. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/api-manager/custom-policy-4-reference[Custom Policy General Reference] (on `+https://docs.mulesoft.com/+`).

Note that Mule 4 is only supported on the new API Manager. See new API Manager documentation, xref:2.x@api-manager::configure-autodiscovery-4-task.adoc[Configuring API Autodiscovery in a Mule 4 Application] (on `+https://docs.mulesoft.com/+`), for how to configure API Gateway.

=== Not supported on Early Access

* Exporting API Analytics to external analytics tool.
* Auto-generating and deploying proxies from API Manager.
* Throttling and Throttling SLA Based policies.
* Studio 7 doesn’t offer support for Gateway.

== Fixed Issues

The issues have been fixed since the Mule 4 RC.
