== Migration Guidance

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
|MULE-9032| BouncyCastle was upgraded to version 1.54. +
[NOTE]
--
DESede algorithm now requires keys of 16 or 24 bytes unlike the prior version which required 16 or 22 bytes.
--
|MULE-9337| TLSv1 is no longer listed as an enabled protocol, by default only TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 will be enabled. +
If you wish to use TLSv1 you can edit the xref:3.7@mule-runtime::tls-configuration.adoc#global-tls-configuration[TLS configuration file] (tls-default.conf) and add it back to the enabled protocols entry.

|MULE-9501| The wildcard-filter will only work with prefix (*.log), suffix (java.util.*) or enclosing strings (*util*) patterns, as well as the deprecated payload based filter (java.lang.Throwable+) and regular strings.

In any other case no match will be possible, regardless of the input. The regex-filter should be used for other cases.

This also affects the wildcard patterns allowed by the file-wildcard-filter, request-wildcard-filter, expression-filter, message-property-filter, exceptions strategies commit-transaction and rollback transaction exception patterns, wildcard patterns used in expressions, among others (complete list can be found in https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/MULE-9501[MULE-9501]).
