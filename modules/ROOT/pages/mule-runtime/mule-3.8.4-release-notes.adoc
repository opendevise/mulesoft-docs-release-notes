*March 31, 2017*

Mule Runtime 3.8.4 includes API Gateway enhancements, bug fixes, and a library change.

Key enhancements are:

* Two new block definitions on the policies are defined: After and Before exception blocks.
+
Similar to the functionality of HTTP after and before blocks, these blocks enhance the catch exception strategy of a flow without the need to modify it.
+
* Increased security by upgrading Gatekeeper to v2.0.
+
The enhancements include cluster support with improved performance, zero security gaps while the feature is in active mode, and small improvements in runtime startup when the feature is in active mode. Several corner cases have been fixed.
+
* XML threat protection policy now can protect also against XXe attacks.
+
* Various security risks related to policies not being correctly applied in particular scenarios addressed.
+
* Performance improvements.

== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule runtime comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 1.6.4.

See xref:runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].


== DataWeave Language Improvements

* Now DataWeave can process input files of any size. Previously the limit was 2GB.
* Improved CSV performance for small files
* Added XML writer option to omit header
* Added another option to specify how missing values are shown with flatfile/copybook output
* Allow trimming a field as per its definition in flatfile
* Changes to support another fill character configuration of '0' to zero-fill text numeric values but space-fill alphas in flatfile
* Added option for truncating output values that are too long for field rather than generating an error in flatfile

== DataWeave Language Bug Fixes

* Fixed temporary files leak when accessing flow vars
* Fixed output encoding in the message
* Now XmlStreamReaders are not consumed with the MEL `dw()` function
* Fixed data-weave not picking up the correct properties file with `p()` function
* Coercion from number to string now doesn't lose precision
* DW now fully supports ISO-8601 format
* XML Indexed reader now supports escaped XML characters

== Migration Guide

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Issue |Description
| MULE-10979 | The default response timeout and default transaction timeout can't be configured using system properties on the command line or in the wrapper.conf file anymore. In replacement, use the configuration element. For example: <configuration defaultResponseTimeout="20000" defaultTransactionTimeout="40000"/>.
| MULE-11118 | The HTTP listener now replies with status code 503 when the thread pool is exhausted (and poolExhaustedAction="ABORT") instead of closing the socket.
