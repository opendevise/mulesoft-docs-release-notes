*August 19, 2016*

Mule Runtime 3.8.1 includes the following enhancements:

* GA support for RAML 1.0
* Improved support for COBOL Copybook with DataWeave
* Support for user defined data types in the database connector
* DataWeave support for bigger files
* Many other bug fixes and improvements

The DataWeave Maven artifactId has changed in this release. COBOL Copybook support for DataWeave is limited. The following release notes describe the change and limitation.

== Supported Software

Mule was tested on the following software:

[%header,cols="15a,85a"]
|===
|Software |Version
|JDK |JRE 1.7.0, JRE 1.8.0 (Recommended JRE 1.8.0_91/92)
|OS |MacOS 10.11.4, HP-UX 11i V3, AIX 7.2, Windows 2012 R2 Server, Windows 8.1, Solaris 11.3, RHEL 7, Ubuntu Server 15.04
|Application Servers |Tomcat 7, Tomcat 8, WebLogic 12c, WildFly 8, WildFly 9, WebSphere 8, Jetty 8, Jetty 9
|Databases |Oracle 11g, Oracle 12c, MySQL 5.5+, DB2 10, PostgreSQL 9, Derby 10, Microsoft SQL Server 2014
|===

The unified Mule Runtime 3.8.1 and API Gateway is compatible with the following software:

* APIkit 3.8.x
* Anypoint Studio 6.0.x and 6.1.0

== Enhancements and Changes

* *DataWeave Support for Bigger Files:*

DataWeave now supports processing files up to 2 GB for XML, JSON and CSV by using temporary files to store the data instead of loading everything in memory. No change is required to DataWeave applications to use this feature. The new capability takes effect automatically. When a file reaches the 1.5MB xref:3.8@mule-runtime::dataweave-memory-management.adoc#memory-vs-disk-usage[threshold], data storage to temporary files begins.

* *Change to DataWeave Maven ArtifactId:*

The artifactId has been changed from `mule-plugin-weave_2.11` to `mule-plugin-weave`.

* *Change to DataWeave auto conversion algorithm:*

The algorithm used to auto convert data types has been modified to make it more predictable. Some conversions might work differently. Specifically sizeOf of a numeric attribute will return 1 now. Note that sizeOf() doesn't support numeric arguments, so it will be autoconverted. In these cases it is recommended to use explicit type coersion. Example: `sizeOf(payload.age as :string)`.

* *Changes to Flat File Format Reader Configuration for DataWeave*

When using an input of type flat file in DataWeave, the `encoding` parameter is no longer available as a reader property. Character encoding is now defined from standard DataWeave conventions (normally: getting it from the Mule message properties).

Added a reader property `missingValues` to control how to represent fields without values.

== Known issues

COBOL Copybook support for DataWeave does not support the following:

* Zoned decimals
* REDEFINEs. You can modify your Copybook to remove the REDEFINE and specify which segment you wish to use.
* COMP-1, COMP-2, COMP-5
* VALUE clauses for non-alphanumeric fields
* DATE FORMAT
* RENAME
* SYNCHRONIZED
* Periods in PIC clauses or in VALUE clauses
* Tab characters in the Copybook

== Migration Guide

If you're migrating from 3.8.0 and using xref:3.8@mule-runtime::using-maven-in-mule-esb.adoc[Mule with Maven] and you are using DataWeave in your projects, you must modify the POM reference to DataWeave, as it has now changed name slightly. See xref:3.8@mule-runtime::dataweave-xml-reference.adoc#maven-dependency-snippet[DataWeave XML Reference] for more details.

== Bundled Runtime Manager Agent

This version of Mule runtime comes bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 1.5.1.

See xref:runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].
