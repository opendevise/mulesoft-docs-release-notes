This version of Mule runtime is bundled with the Runtime Manager Agent plugin version 2.1.1.

== API Gateway v4.1.1 Features and Enhancements

This patch version allows to specify Organization client ID and secret instead of only allowing Environment credentials. This feature allows customers using Business Groups to track all APIs  that are children of the organization which the runtime is configure to use.

Also, this version enhances analytics data with Host name information.

API Gateway 4.1.1 supports again the ability to specify multiple configurations for policies.
