== 1.3.0

*October 3, 2016*

Changes in this release:

- Added support to set a Call Context to be used within each operation.

== 1.2.0

*June 3, 2016*

Changes in this release:

- Optimized Windows Gateway bandwidth from connector by adding GZIP compression to request/responses.
- Added timeout configuration settings (optionally setable).
- Improved exception handling.

== 1.1.2

*March 23, 2016*

Changes in this release:

- Fixed metadata retrieval bug for datasense. When inbound/outbound ports are not configured over the net.tcp adapter their metadata is not retrieved and, in consequence, they are not shown through Datasense. In addition, net.tcp services that are not deployed within the AOS are not shown either.

== 1.1.1

*December 15, 2015*

Changes in this release:

- Fix stability issues when the connector was run with other connectors that use the CXF libraries.

== 1.1.0

*August 26, 2015*

Changes in this release:

The connector is now able to autodiscover the AX service endpoint address and port from the WSDL of the service. It is still possible to manually override in the global element configuration with the `aosEndpointPort` parameter, but this field is now optional instead of mandatory.

== 1.0.0

*July 15, 2015*

New in this release:

* In addition to executing static and user-defined queries, you can now create documents in AX using the new Document Service interface.
* Improved interactive performance is achieved by fetching WSDL files in parallel and caching them.

== 0.9.0

*May 8, 2015*
