_Premium_

The Mule Runtime supports the AS2 protocol through our Anypoint Connector for AS2, which is an AS2-certified Java connector that leverages the AS2 Java Connector libraries.

AS2 (Applicability Statement 2) is a specification about how to transport data securely and reliably over the Internet. Security is achieved by using digital certificates and encryption.
