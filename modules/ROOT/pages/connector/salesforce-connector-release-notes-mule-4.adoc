* Getting NullPointerException while retrieving input metadata when describing reference type objects:

```
org.mule.runtime.api.metadata.MetadataResolvingException: Unable to resolve metadata for: Account
Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException: Request headers cannot be null.
```

The problem was solved by reimplementing the metadata parsing for reference type objects.

* The customer was getting intermittently the below exception:

```
[UnexpectedErrorFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_SESSION_ID'
 exceptionMessage='Invalid Session ID found in SessionHeader: Illegal Session. Session not found, missing session hash: <hash>
This error usually occurs after a session expires or a user logs out. '
```

The problem was solved by adding missing error handling for reconnection due to invalid session.

== 9.1.1

*May 2, 2018*

=== Compatibility

Salesforce connector version 9.1.1 is compatible with:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Application/Service |Version
|Mule Runtime |Mule Enterprise Edition 4.1.0 and later
|Anypoint Studio |Only works with Studio 7.1.0 and later
|Salesforce |v37.0, v38.0, v39.0, v40.0, v41.0
|===

=== Features

* Added the isForceResubscribe method in Salesforce Bayeux Client.
* Support for Anypoint Studio Proxy configuration as the default.

=== Fixed in this Release

 * Trigger operation did not retrieve MetadataKeysId. Solved by adding support for retrieving metadata in case of sources.
 * Reply topic was losing messages in case the connection has been lost for less than 40 seconds; this is the amount of time that was needed to trigger re-subscribe naturally according to Salesforce documentation. The issue was solved by forcing re-subscription whenever the network connection is lost.
 * Buffering capacity exceeded message was triggered when the connector consumed more than 10000 messages from a topic. The issue was solved by adding a new attribute for the "Replay streaming channel" operation: Buffer Size In Bytes, it's an optional parameter with the default value of 26 MB.
 * Wrong transformation of fields of type Date. Trying to update or insert an Object in Salesforce with fields of type Date caused a failure, this was due to failure in serializing the objects of type Date. The issue was solved by parsing the values received from the Mule flow and converting them into the expected Salesforce accepted format.
