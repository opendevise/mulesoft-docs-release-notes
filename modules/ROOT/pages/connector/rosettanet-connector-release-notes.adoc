_Premium_

The Anypoint Connector for RosettaNet sends and receives RosettaNet messages
using RNIF 2.00.01. The connector automatically handles send timeouts and retries,
and responds to received messages with the appropriate HTTP response and/or
signal. Users work directly with the RosettaNet message service content as an XML document.
