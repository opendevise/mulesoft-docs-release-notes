== API Designer 0.4.13 Release Notes

August 23, 2018

=== Enhancement

The JS parser is now at version 1.1.45.

=== Fixed Issue

The requirement in the RAML 1.0 specification that the `protocols` node "be a non-empty array of strings, of values HTTP and/or HTTPS" and be case-insensitive, is now enforced. In previous releases, values such as this one were allowed:

```
protocols: HTTPS
```

Now, the use of brackets to denote the value as an array is required:

```
protocols: [ HTTPS ]
```



== API Designer 0.4.12 Release Notes

June 28, 2018

=== Fixed Issues

* Importing an API specification written in OAS 2.0 sometimes resulted in the following error: `Failed to parse Swagger: Swagger schema validation failed.`
* Resolved an issue with a warning message `path exceeds file system root at (_position in file_).` that  should not have appeared for an API specification in the code editor in the following situation: A fragment where the notation `../` is used in a path that references a file that is in a subdirectory of an upper level.

== API Designer 0.4.11 Release Notes

May 19, 2018

* API Console is now at https://github.com/mulesoft/api-console/releases/tag/v3.0.28[v3.0.28].
* The OAS RAML converter is now at version 1.1.32.
* There are enhancements to the RAML suggestions made by the editor.

=== Fixed Issues
* Using facet items in a data type other than Array resulted in an error.
* Supplying a base URI parameter in the visual API Designer, using the parameter in a base URI, closing the visual API Designer, and then reopening the project resulted in an error message and a blank middle panel.
* Selecting the type Number for a new Data Type in the visual API Designer, specifying a format, and changing the type to Integer resulted in the RAML viewer still including the specified number format.
* Changing the type for a base URI parameter caused the RAML viewer to show the new type, but the *Type* field continued to show the previously selected type.
* The OAS-to-RAML converter did not recognize the API Key authentication type. If you tried to import an OAS file that used this type of authentication, the import failed.
