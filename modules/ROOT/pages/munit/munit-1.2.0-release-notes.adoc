== Migration Guidance

Tests that work in 1.0.0 also work in 1.2.0

== Known Issues

* MUnit RAML-to-Test autogeneration feature does not support RAML 1.0. We are actively working to evolve the feature.
* When running an MUnit test over Windows without admin right, you may find a "_could not load library jansi_" error. This is due to jar file that log4j uses that tries to use this _dll_ library and if it can not find it then it tries to create it under `java.io.tmpdir` system property. +
If the user do not have write permissions to that directory which Windows always returns as `C:\Windows` it will fail. +
The workaround is to overwrite that property in the lunch configuration: `Djava.io.tmpdir=D:\Users\myUserName` or run Studio as an Administrator
