== Features and Functionality

=== Anypoint Studio Plugin

There are no new features in this release

=== MUnit Runtime

MUnit 2.0 is the next major version of MUnit built for Mule 4.

It features an easier to use DSL, and integration with Mule 4's major new capabilities. It leverages new Mule 4’s mechanisms ensuring that integration with Mule 4 will run smoothly now and for any upcoming releases.

We have a brand new feature call Tags. You can now “tag” each and every single MUnit test you code. The tag works as a transversal grouping of test across all your Test Suites, offering a new way to organize your test. You can also have them run by these tags allowing you to tune your CICD times and grouping your tests, for instance, in nightly test, smoke test, full regression, etc.

== Known Issues

* *MUnit Runtime*
** No Spy Processor
