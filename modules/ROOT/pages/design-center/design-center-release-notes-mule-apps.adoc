== 1.5.1

*September 8, 2018*

This release includes the following enhancements and fixes. There were also several improvements to security.

=== Enhancements

* The new Visual Function Editor lets you drag and drop message objects into function fields.
* Automapping (Beta) is now available when a source card and a destination card are placed around a Transform card.
* You can zoom out of the canvas to a limit of 17% magnification.
* You can now design Mule apps on 720p monitors.
* The tool for designing Mule apps now uses Mule Runtime 4.1.3.


=== Fixes

* It was possible for cards to overlap the name of the current flow, which appears in the top-left corner of the canvas.
* Open Try cards overlapped other cards within the Try scope.
* If you selected text in a function field, after an interval of 5 to 10 seconds, the text would be deselected automatically.
* If you pressed Shift+Option+up while your cursor was on a line in a function field, the field duplicated the line. This problem occurred only on systems running macOS.
* At rare times, if you clicked the Run button, the status message would change from “Ready to run” to “Starting application” and then return to “Ready to run”, never reaching the state “Running”.
* The checkboxes in the Type card for Try scopes were misaligned
* It was possible to change to a deprecated version of a connector.
* If you dragged the log panel to its full height, the text on the Expand Logs button on the right side of the top bar of the panel did not change to Collapse Logs. Also, you had to click the button twice for the panel to collapse.
* Fixes to error counts:
+
** The number of errors that are in a flow are always indicated in two locations:
*** For an entire flow, the number of errors appears next to the name of the flow in the sidebar.
*** For each card, the number of errors appears on the top-right corner of the card.
+
The resolved issue was that if a card lacked a configuration, an error would be counted for the card but not for the entire flow.

** If a card requires a driver, but no driver is selected for it, the count of errors for the card should be incremented by 1. This increment was not occurring.
** If a card required another card to follow it, but no subsequent card had yet been added, the error count on the original card was incremented by 1, and the + symbol displayed an error count of 1. Therefore, one error was counted twice.
** When a For Each card is created, it is created with an error count of 1 because the scope requires a card. The resolved issue was that, if a card was moved into the scope, the error went away, as it should have; however, if the added card was removed, the error count on the For Each card was not incremented by 1.

* Fixes to connectors:
** Under certain conditions, the Microsoft ServiceBus Anypoint Connector would log this error message:
+
`ERROR 20:34:47   Could not serialize object of type: 'class org.mule.modules.microsoftservicebus.extension.api.entity.AmqpMessage' to JSON. Error: StackOverflowError:`

* Fixes to support for DataWeave:
** Support for the Infix notation did not work.
** It was not possible to create a custom type from a payload.

== 1.5.0

*August 25, 2018*

This release includes the following enhancements and fixes.

=== Enhancements

* The speed and accuracy of mapping recommender within the Transform card has been improved.
* When you configure a Database card to use a Derby connection, Microsoft SQL Server connection, or MySQL connection, a default driver is selected automatically. Therefore, you no longer need to upload a driver unless you want to use a specific one.
* When deploying a working Mule application to a new environment, most of the time you do not have to change the configuration of the connectors. Therefore, in the Deploy Mule Application to CloudHub dialog, the fields for changing the configuration values for connectors are no longer visible unless you click the new *Advanced* button.
* In the *Logs* section, you can now hover over a line and click *COPY* to copy a line of text.
* The left-pane is now collapsed by default when projects for Mule applications first open.
* Payload attributes are now listed on the left side of all cards other than cards used as triggers and Transform cards. They are listed to make it easier for you to work in the visual function editor, which is available for many fields.

=== Fixed Issues

* The *Script* tab on the Transform card was disabled in some scenarios. The tab is now always enabled.
* In For Each cards, it is now possible to delete the default expression that is in the *Collection* field, which is `payload`. In the previous release, there was an issue that prevented this default value from being deleted.
* Script errors are now flagged where they occur in the Transform card and in all fields that take DataWeave expressions. Such errors also now prevent applications from being run.
* When an icon is missing for a connector, a custom default icon appears in its place, rather than the "missing image" icon that appears by default in browsers.
* Several issues in the *Logs* section were fixed.


== 1.4.7

*July 12, 2018*

This release includes enhancements and fixed issues that are related to designing Mule applications.

=== Enhancement

* You can now hover your mouse cursor over the name of a card to see a tooltip with the card's full name. You no longer have to open a card to see its full name.
* When you rename a card, you can now specify a name that is up to 50 characters long. In previous releases, the maximum number of characters was 15.
* If you rename the card for an HTTP Listener, the name can now contain forward slashes.



=== Fixed Issues

* The option to restart your workspace was available while the workspace was being created. If you selected the option during the creation of your workspace because you thought that the creation process had stalled, the creation process would restart, leading to further delay before your project was ready for you to work in.
* You can now rename the operations that are displayed on cards the Choice, For Each, Transform, and Try components.
* An issue could occur in an HTTP Listener card if you opened the card, clicked *Responses*, and clicked the *Map* button for the *Body* field in the *Error Response* section. Each array has an options icon. If you click this icon, the menu that appears allows you to set an expression. However, if an array contained at least one item, the options icon disappeared from the entry for the array. The option for setting an expression then appeared on the menu opened by clicking the options icon for the first array item, as in this image.

image::design-center/dcfd147issue.png[]

* If you typed in a text field in a card and then clicked the *&fnof;(x)* button to open function editor, what you had typed was deleted, though it should have remained in the field.
* If a user that had the Design Center Developer role, but that did not have the CloudHub administrator role, opened a project, the project was locked in read-only mode with the status message set to "Loading…". The project remained locked for five minutes.
* It was possible to deploy an application even if a script in a Transform card contained errors.
* The *Save* button was not enabled in the *Edit Type* dialog that appears when you edit the output data type in an error response for an HTTP Listener.
* If you were working in a Mule-application project, logged out of Design Center by clicking your profile icon in the top-right corner and selecting *Sign Out*, logged into Design Center again, and attempted to reopen the project, you would encounter this message: `Project locked: This project is currently being used by another user. You will be redirected to the project list.`
* When more than one type was specified in the subcard of a Try card and the subcard was subsequently closed, reopening the subcard displayed the *Type* and *When* fields, as well as the *Log Exceptions*, and *Enable Notification* check boxes, shifted to the left.
* In a Transform card, if you mapped an input field to an output field, selected the parent field in the list of output fields, removed the mapping, and then mapped another input field to an output field, this second mapping would not be displayed correctly. Switching to another tab in the card, such as *Script* or *Sample data*, and then switching back would cause the mapping to appear correctly.


== 1.4.6

*June 16, 2018*

This release includes new features, enhancements, fixed issues, and known issues for designing Mule applications.

=== New Features and Enhancements

* When you select the option to restart your workspace, you will be asked to give your reason for doing so. Your responses will help MuleSoft assess the stability of the user interface.
* The error messages related to running and deploying applications are improved.
* If you do not reopen an existing project for five days, the worker for it is terminated. In past releases, when you reopened a project after that amount of time, a new worker was not provisioned for the project until you opened a card, which could cause longer than expected wait times for the values in the card to appear. Now, when you reopen a project 5 days after last using it, a new worker is provisioned for the project immediately.
* The navigation bar at the top of the screen has been redesigned to improve the experience of running and deploying applications.

=== Fixed Issues

* The panel that shows the log for an application now expands and collapses more smoothly.
* The MIME Type and Encoding options on the Set Payload and Set Variable cards are now removed and the values are set to the appropriate defaults.

=== Known Issues
The known issues that were in the 1.4.5 release continue into this release:

* REST Connect connectors display their `artifactId`, instead of their name.
* The option to set an expression for repeated elements is temporarily disabled because this option is not currently supported by the DataWeave API.
* In some cases, the list of items in drop-down fields extends below the boundary of the current card, as in this image:
+
image::design-center/dc-menu-problem.png[]
* If you use 5.1.33 or later versions of the MySQL driver in a Database connector, your Mule application might run out of memory.

== 1.4.5

*May 31, 2018*

This release includes new features, enhancements, resolved issues, and known issues for designing Mule applications.

=== New Features and Enhancements

* An improved algorithm for mapping suggestions in the Transform component.
* Support for the Set Payload and Set Variable components.
* Automatic naming of flows created by the Getting Started wizard. For example, if you use the wizard to create a flow with the following components:
  ** Trigger: An HTTP component with _Listener_ selected as its operation
  ** Target: A Database component with _Insert_ selected as its operation

+
Then, the default name for your flow is _HTTP listener to Database insert_.
* Support for renaming the operations that are displayed on cards. On a card, open the actions menu by clicking the three-dots icon and then select *Rename Card*. This option is not present on these cards: Choice, For Each, Transform, Try.
* Automatic selection of the latest driver type for the selected connection type in the Database connector. When you open the *Database Drivers* dialog to select a database driver, the latest version is automatically selected after you click the arrow in the selection field.

=== Fixed Issues

* Several bugs in functioning of the Transform card were fixed.
* Several minor bugs in user interface were fixed.

=== Known Issues
The known issues that were in the 1.4.0 release continue to be in this release:

* Rest Connect connectors display their `artifactId`, instead of their name.
* The option to set an expression for repeated elements is temporarily disabled because this option is not currently supported by the DataWeave API.
* In some cases, the list of items in drop-down fields extends below the boundary of the current card, as in this image:
+
image::design-center/dc-menu-problem.png[]

* The user experience for writing sample data in a transformation of Web Service Consumer output needs to be improved. You need to use a workaround to write this sample data.

*Workaround*

Format the output of sample data in a transformation of Web Service Consumer output as follows:

[source,text,linenums]
----
output application/java
---
{
    "body": read('put web service consumer body sample here on a single line', 'application/xml')
}
----

Place the Web Service consumer body sample on a single line.

*Example*

[source,text,linenums]
----
output application/java
---
{
    "body": read('<ns2:listAllFlightsResponse  xmlns:ns2="http://soap.training.mulesoft.com/"><return><airlineName>Delta</airlineName><code>A1B2C3</code><departureDate>2015/03/20</departureDate><destination>SFO</destination><emptySeats>40</emptySeats><origin>MUA</origin><planeType>Boing 737</planeType><price>400.0</price></return><return><airlineName>Delta</airlineName><code>SIL</code><departureDate>2015/03/20</departureDate><destination>SFO</destination><emptySeats>40</emptySeats><origin>MUA</origin><planeType>Boeing 737</planeType><price>400.0</price></return></ns2:listAllFlightsResponse>', 'application/xml')

* Fixed an issue that caused the failure of discriminators to identify existing subtypes even though subtypes were defined in an external file.

== 1.1

*September 30, 2017*

This release incorporates new features, changes, and bug fixes.

*Summary of enhancements*

* New flow design features at the runtime level
* DataWeave and UX improvements
* Capability to open a project in a new tab
* Warnings of an API design file or directory deletion


=== Features and Changes

* To simplify DataWeave scripts, the `variable` keyword is replaced by `vars`.

* Email connector: `#[payload.body]` is now available to access the body with or without attachments.

* WebServiceConsumer and SC based extensions: Soap Headers have been moved from attributes to the payload.  For accessing the body with or without attachments `#[payload.body]` is now available.

* Reconnection and connectivity testing: when connectivity is tested at start time but fails, the default behavior now is to log a warning message and continue with the deployment. Also, operations can now have a reconnection strategy different from the one in the connector configuration.

* DataWeave improvements: now arrays of binary data are supported and data type names or type aliases are displayed as labels in the input/output view.

* You can now right-click a project name and choose Open in a new tab.

=== Known Issues

* Some of the limitations of v1.0.2 apply to this version.
* Literal arrays cannot be edited from the function editor in the transform.
* To use Object Store v2, the user needs certain entitlements. Otherwise, Object Store V1 is used.
* Web Service Consumer XML validation error leaves application in a failed state.
* Re-login popup and some other issues with Safari version 10.1.2 and 11.0.0.
* Adding another connector next to the WSC requires the use of a transformation between them .
* Adding a Data Type from the Live View for a WSC is not possible.

*Known Issues -- Applies to Mule Applications Created in Design Center 1.0 - 1.0.3*

* Flows using Email without attachments trying to access the body. To access the body, you need to use `payload.body` instead of `payload`.
* Flows using Web Service Consumer having transformations or expressions using `attributes.headers` need to be updated to `payload.headers`.
* Flows using cards that enable Reconnection Strategy need to be re-setup to start using the runtime functionality changes.
* The output for Web Service Consumer and Email is now changed from a `MultipartPayload` to an object; therefore, some applications may stop working until the output mapping is fixed.

* Fixed an issue with the deletion of special characters from resources that included uriParameters.
* The autocomplete option is no longer hidden by other components from the UI.

=== 1.0.2

*August 12, 2017*

This release includes in-app links to documentation, it also includes bug fixes in several components such as the Choice, Try, and Transform components.

==== Resolved Issues

* For the Choice component, the Default option isn't shown by default unless the user adds it initially.
* A parser error occurs when adding a Try card. This is because it's not made clear that the Type field is required.
* Missing tooltips on the top (right) toolbar - the following were added: "Download Mule Application" and "Support".
* Auto completion doesn't work in the DataWeave function editor.
* DataWeave unnecessarily underlines the script as having an error.
* Improve transformer inline function editor error handling in DataWeave. Errors aren't shown in the DataWeave inline Function Editor because the provided model caused false errors during scoping.
* The Transform Message component forces you to select a mapping when you shouldn't have to.
* Suggestions get cut off in the Choice card.
* When restarting a workspace, an error is shown before the workspace is created.
* File leak issue in the Execution Service.
* Improve Transform component`s performance.
* Null File-Name error issue in Runtime Manager.


==== Known Issues

* The Same limitations from version 1.0.0 apply to this version.
* Live View for Transform Card is not working when placed before a DataBase card.
* Dictionary Editor is not working in Windows chrome.
* Literal arrays can not be edited from function editor in the transform.
* Web Service Consumer XML validation error leaves application in a failed state.
* Target Variable is not working for Foreach.


=== 1.0.1

*August 4, 2017*

This release included the following improvements:

* Fix around the Get Started button: it's hidden when a user has no API Designer entitlement
* Segment.io integration fixes
* 3 minor UI fixes


=== 1.0

*July 29, 2017*


This release includes the new web-based Design Center that enables you to easily create web-based integration flows, design API specifications, and create reusable API fragments.

==== Flow designer

With release you can:

* Create and manage Mule application projects.
* Design flows using a simple step-by-step process with the ability to quickly navigate to Exchange to see more information.
* Connect to systems and protocols using different connectors, including databases, FTP, HTTP, SOAP web services, Salesforce, Workday, and others.
* Support for REST connect, which provides a connector in the component selector for every API that is published in Exchange. This enables you to discover APIs as part of your design process and consume them without having to know the details of how the API works.
* Perform complex data transformations using DataWeave with a visual drag-and-drop editor.
* View live data, so you can easily debug your flows.
* Create and manage data types for XML, JSON, CSV, and objects.
* Control the flow of data:
** Choice Router enables you to make logical decisions and route to specific event processors or other flows.
** For Each Scope enables you to loop over payload content.
** Try Scope enables you to incorporate error-handling logic into your flows. Using error handlers, you can select specific error types that could occur, and define a behavior to deal with each.
** Flow Refs enable you to call out to other flows from your main flow.
* Store and retrieve information from the Mule Object Store.
* Use design environments, which enable you to develop applications using flow designer, without consuming your Sandbox vCores.
* Manage dependencies, so you can control the versions of your connectors and modules, to upgrade or downgrade at any time.

Underpinning this release is the initial release of Mule 4.0 Runtime. This release is currently only available to Design Center users. More details on what’s new in Mule 4 can be found in the Mule Runtime section.


==== API designer

This release of Design Center enables you to:

* Edit RAML API specifications and fragments.
* Publish and consume reusable API fragments, so that common best practices, data types, or security schemes can be reused across APIs.
* Mock and test APIs.
* Import and export Open API Specification (OAS) 2.0.
* Create and delete branches for your API specification or fragment.
* View projects in edit and read-only mode to avoid conflicts in collaboration.
* See suggestions and discover RAML syntax via a “shelf” built.
* Preview your API with the new RAML console.

==== Known Issues (Flow designer)
* Currently the flow designer is not supported on IE Browser
* Exporting to Studio, some DataWeave expressions on fields aren't exported. Specifically those that reference nested elements using selectors.
* Metadata: While creating the application, no metadata is resolved until the worker is finally created. Once the application is running, the metadata will be refreshed for existing cards in the flow.
* Live View does not properly show list of message objects for FTP List operations.
* Live View - sometimes Consume is not retrieving anything, therefore live view does not show anything
* Publishing assets to exchange or uploading Drivers. User will need to have exchange permissions. Also a more accurate error is required to be retrieved when not having enough permissions
* Currently Datasense is not supported for Flow Ref
* Transform presents some mapping simple types issues
* Cloning Projects is only available for Mule Applications type projects
* The validation all operation is not available
* Project management view does not show correct dates in the project list and in the detail panel
* Unlock takes 5 min to unlock a project
* Test connectivity failure causes deployment failure
* Uploading files for every connector other than HTTP, like keystores or private keys, is not currently supported


==== Known Issues (API designer)

* In a Try scope, selecting errors of Type `CORE` in the error handler doesn't work.

* The For Each scope doesn't support using a target variable as an output.

* Users cannot move files to a folder via drag and drop in Firefox

* API Designer does not delete baseUri parameter if header of file is changed to a fragment and mocking server is running
