*October 14, 2016*

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition takes all the power of the platform MuleSoft developed for the Cloud and enables companies to run the platform inside their data centers.  In this release we are releasing solutions for APIs, Runtime Management and Exchange.



== Features

=== API Manager

xref:api-manager::index.adoc[API Manager] is a multi-tenant end-to-end platform for enterprise API design, implementation, management, and engagement.

=== Anypoint Runtime Manager

xref:runtime-manager::index.adoc[Runtime Manager] enables users to enhance their unified monitoring experience by easily integrating their on-premises Mule servers and API Gateways with third parties’ monitoring tools, such as Splunk & ELK, for monitoring, analytics and governance.


The Private Cloud Edition of Runtime Manager is also enabled to deploy applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry (Beta). See xref:1.5@anypoint-platform-pcf::pcf-workflow.adoc[Configuring Anypoint Platform for PCF].


=== Anypoint Exchange

xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange] enables users to publish and access Mule-related content within their own organization increasing visibility and reuse across organizations.

=== Anypoint Access Management

xref:access-management::index.adoc[Access Management] is an underlying platform solution that allows customers to seamlessly integrate their existing authentication provider for centralized user management.



== System Requirements

See xref:1.5@private-cloud::system-requirements.adoc[About Minimum System Requirements] for installing the platform on premises.

== Current differences with the Cloud Version
There are some differences between the current On-premises release and the Cloud version.

=== Runtime Manager
* In the On Premises release, CloudHub is not an available deployment target.
* xref:runtime-manager::deploying-to-pcf.adoc[PCF] is available as a beta deployment target.
* Runtime Manager doesn't include dashboards or insights
* Some alerts (related to server usage) aren't available

=== API Manager
* The *auto-deploy proxy* is not available via the UI for PCF
* Proxies can be automatically deployed to PCF via the command line
* Analytics aren't available

=== Anypoint Exchange
This is a private version of Anypoint Exchange, so you will not be able to see the public content available in the Cloud Version.

=== Other Differences
The Private Cloud Edition of the Anypoint Platform only includes the Runtime Manager, API Manager and Exchange. None of the other tools, such as MQ or Data Gateway.
